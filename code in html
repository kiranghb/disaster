                <h2>About Disaster Management</h2>
                <p>Disaster management refers to the process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural or man-made disasters. It involves a systematic approach to minimize the impact of disasters on lives, property, and the environment.</p>
                <p>Disaster preparedness and response are crucial components of disaster management. Preparedness involves activities such as risk assessment, early warning systems, emergency drills, and the development of response plans. It aims to ensure that individuals, communities, and organizations are equipped to deal with potential disasters effectively.</p>
                <p>Response involves the immediate actions taken during and after a disaster to save lives, protect property, and meet the basic needs of affected populations. This includes emergency medical care, search and rescue operations, evacuation efforts, and the provision of food, water, and shelter. A prompt and coordinated response can significantly reduce the impact of disasters and save lives.</p>
                <p>Overall, disaster management plays a crucial role in building resilience and reducing vulnerability to disasters. By investing in preparedness, communities can minimize the loss of life and property, recover more quickly from disasters, and ultimately enhance their ability to withstand future events.</p>
